# Air Quality Prediction using Multiplicative LSTM (MLSTM)

## Overview

Air pollution is a pressing global concern with substantial consequences for public health and the environment. This project introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at improving the accuracy of air quality predictions through advanced machine learning techniques. Specifically, we leverage the **Multiplicative Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM)** model to predict air quality levels based on historical data. The project covers the entire process, from **data preprocessing** and **model development** to **validation using regression metrics**.

The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning in improving air quality forecasts, contributing to efforts for better environmental management and public health outcomes.

## Key Components

### 1. **Multiplicative LSTM (MLSTM)**
- The MLSTM model is used to predict air quality indices based on historical pollution data.
- Why MLSTM?
  - MLSTM is an advanced recurrent neural network (RNN) model that is particularly effective in handling time-series data by capturing long-term dependencies and patterns, making it ideal for air quality prediction.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps including data cleaning, normalization, and handling missing values to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Dataset partitioning**: The data is split into training, validation, and test sets.

### 3. **Evaluation Metrics**
- The model's performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset contains time-series air pollution data including:
- **Pollutant levels** (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3)
- **Meteorological data** (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed)


## Results

The MLSTM model significantly improves the precision of air quality predictions compared to traditional methods. Evaluation on real-world datasets using MSE and RMSE metrics demonstrates the modelâ€™s effectiveness in capturing complex patterns in air pollution data, leading to more accurate forecasting.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the role of advanced machine learning techniques in addressing global environmental challenges. The use of MLSTM for air quality prediction provides a powerful tool for improving forecasts, thereby aiding in public health protection and environmental conservation efforts.

## Future Work

- **Incorporate more features**: Explore additional meteorological factors and seasonal patterns to improve model accuracy.
- **Real-time prediction**: Implement the system for real-time air quality forecasting.
- **Deploy the model**: Develop a web application or API for users to query real-time predictions.
